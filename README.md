####What does it do?  

*Watch Atlas is a D3.js visualization of global Youtube trends.*

####Why this idea?

As part of its Trends Dashboard, Youtube now includes a Trends Map (<https://www.youtube.com/trendsmap>). However, the map is limited to US trends and is currently displayed against a pretty bland 2D map backdrop. So while it is a cool, useful feature, it definitely still has room for improvement. 

Considering the sheer amount of data Youtube collects about global video trends, my group for this project at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive decided we could do them one better. **By tapping into the Youtube API and the powerful D3 Javascript library, we created a simple, yet engaging way to browse Youtube trends across the globe (in the 62 countries that Youtube provides data on, that is).**

####How do I use it?
* Drag the globe or click the side arrows to navigate around the world.
* Hover over a country to immediately see its top three videos.
* Click on a country to view a detailed breakdown of top videos (overall, and from a variety of categories) as well as statistics that compare that country's viewing patterns with others around the globe.
